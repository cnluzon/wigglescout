Description: Wigglescout is a set of tools to easily extract, summarize and
  visualize coverage on bigWig files. It provides a set of functions that
  calculate summary values genome-wide or in a locus-specific way. On top of
  these calculation functions, an out-of-the-box set of plotting functions is
  provided, to make figures like scatterplots, heatmaps, and profile plots.
  Wigglescout is built on top of widely used libraries, such as rtracklayer,
  GenomicRanges, dplyr and ggplot2.
