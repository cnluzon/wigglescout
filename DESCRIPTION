Description: A set of tools to easily extract, summarize and visualize coverage
  on bigWig files. It provides a set of functions that calculate summary values
  genome-wide or in a locus-specific way. On top of these calculation functions,
  a set of plotting functions is provided, to make figures like scatterplots,
  heatmaps, and profile plots.
